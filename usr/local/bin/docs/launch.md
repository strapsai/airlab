# Launch Command Documentation

## Overview
The `airlab launch` command manages tmux sessions for robot control, supporting both local and remote operations through YAML configuration files.

## Syntax
```
airlab launch <robot_name> [options]
```

## Arguments
- `<robot_name>`: Name of the robot to launch (must be defined in robots.yaml)
  - Use 'local' as the robot name to launch locally

## Options
- `--yaml_file=<file_name>`: Specify an alternative YAML launch file
  - Defaults to the path specified in LAUNCH_FILE_PATH environment variable
  - Path should be relative to the robot's workspace
- `--stop`: Stop the tmux session instead of starting it
- `--password`: Skip key-based SSH authentication and prompt for a password directly (remote operations only)
- `--help`: Display usage information

## Environment Variables
- `LAUNCH_FILE_PATH`: Default path to the launch file in the robot's workspace
  - Can be modified using the `airlab env set` command

## Examples
```bash
# Launch locally using default launch file
airlab launch local

# Launch on remote system using default launch file
airlab launch mt001

# Stop tmux session on remote system
airlab launch mt001 --stop

# Launch specific YAML file on remote system mt001
airlab launch mt001 --yaml_file=mt002.yaml

# Stop specific YAML file's tmux session on remote system mt001
airlab launch mt001 --yaml_file=mt002.yaml --stop
```

## Configuration
### Robot Configuration
- Defined in `robots.yaml`
- Must contain robot definitions for remote operations
- Robot names in the command must match entries in this configuration

## Important Notes
1. The YAML file path should always be relative to the robot's workspace
2. Use 'local' as the robot name for local operations
3. The default launch file can be changed using the `airlab env set` command
4. Remote operations require proper configuration in robots.yaml

## Error Handling
The command includes error checking for:
- Invalid robot names
- Missing YAML files
- Invalid options
- Configuration errors

## Dependencies
Required components:
- tmux
- Robot registry (robots.yaml)
- YAML launch files
