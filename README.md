# Airlab: Simplified Deployment for Robotic Systems


`airlab` is a command-line tool designed to streamline and simplify deployment workflows for robotic systems, both locally and remotely.  It unifies common tasks such as file synchronization, launch file management, and environment configuration by integrating industry-standard tools like `rsync`, `docker`, and `tmux` under a single, consistent interface.  This reduces complexity and accelerates development and deployment cycles, making `airlab` an invaluable asset for robotics engineers and developers.

## Key Features

*   **File Synchronization:**  Provides an easy and efficient method for transferring files between local and remote systems.
*   **Launch Management:** Simplifies the process of launching and managing robotic system launch files, especially using `tmux` sessions.
*   **Environment Setup:** Automates the configuration of necessary environments on remote systems.
*   **Multi-Repository Workflows:** Beyond `vcstool`'s init/pull/push/status, the `vcs` family also supports cross-workspace **drift detection** (`airlab vcs check`), **recursive tagging with deduplicated push** (`airlab vcs tag`), and **recursive branch / tag checkout with a colored post-state summary** (`airlab vcs checkout`), which are essential when the same source repository is cloned across many sub-workspaces.
*   **User-Defined Aliases:** `airlab a <name>` runs custom verbs — plain `.sh` / `.py` scripts under `$AIRLAB_ALIAS_PATH` — with auto-completion, a discovery list, and a lintable authoring contract. Ideal for wrapping a complex `ansible-playbook` (or any procedure) into one short, shareable command.
*   **Unified Interface:** Consolidates various tools and processes into a single command-line utility.
*   **Debian Package:**  Offers a simple and reliable installation and update mechanism via a Debian package.

## Installation

`airlab` is intended to be installed on the host machine from which you control remote robotic systems. Remote systems are then configured using the `setup` command.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Docker Engine:**  Install Docker Engine using the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#installation-methods).

2.  **NVIDIA Container Toolkit:** Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit according to the [official NVIDIA documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html). This also requires the CUDA Toolkit and NVIDIA Driver, which can be found [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kabirkedia/airlab.git
    ```

2.  **Run the install script:**

    ```bash
    cd airlab
    ./install.sh
    ```

    The install script handles the full installation process:
    -   Installs apt dependencies (`python3-pip`, `python3-venv`, etc.)
    -   Creates a Python virtual environment at `~/VENVs/airlab`
    -   Installs Python dependencies (`pyyaml`, `vcstool`, etc.)
    -   Builds and installs the `airlab` Debian package

    **Virtual environment options:**

    If the `~/VENVs/airlab` virtual environment already exists, the script will prompt you to remove and re-create it or keep the existing one. You can also control this behavior with command-line flags:

    ```bash
    # Always remove and re-create the venv (no prompt)
    ./install.sh --override-venv

    # Error out if the venv already exists (no prompt)
    ./install.sh --no-override-venv

    # Skip venv creation entirely — use whatever venv is currently active
    ./install.sh --skip-venv
    ```

    The `--skip-venv` option is useful when you manage your own virtual environment (e.g., conda, poetry, or a shared team venv). It requires that a virtual environment is already active in the current terminal session. Python dependencies will be installed into that active venv instead of creating `~/VENVs/airlab`.

    **Skip apt installs:**

    If you've already installed the apt dependencies (or want to manage them yourself), use `--skip-apt` to skip both `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt install` in `install.sh` and `install_dependencies_ubuntu24.sh`:

    ```bash
    ./install.sh --skip-apt
    ```

    This flag can be combined with the venv flags, e.g., `./install.sh --skip-venv --skip-apt`.

3.  **(Optional) Install Missing Dependencies:** This command can attempt to fix broken installations by installing missing dependencies. While it can be helpful, it's generally more reliable to ensure all prerequisites are installed beforehand.

    ```bash
    sudo apt install -f -y
    ```

### Post-Installation Notes
After installing airlab you can run the command to setup the environment `airlab setup local or <robot>`

### Tab Auto-Completion

`airlab` ships with tab-completion for both **Bash** and **Zsh** out of the box.

**Bash:** The completion script is installed to `/etc/bash_completion.d/airlab` as part of the Debian package and is automatically sourced by new shell sessions.

**Zsh:** The completion function is installed to `/usr/share/zsh/vendor-completions/_airlab` and is automatically discovered by zsh's completion system. The `airlab` shell function (needed for `airlab cd`) is installed to `/etc/airlab/airlab.zsh` and sourced from `~/.zshrc` during installation.

**What it completes:**

*   **Sub-commands:** `airlab <TAB>` lists all available commands (`setup`, `ssh`, `sync`, `vcs`, etc.).
*   **Options and flags:** `airlab sync mt001 <TAB>` lists `--dry-run`, `--delete`, `--path=`, `--exclude=`, etc.
*   **Robot names:** Commands that take a robot name (e.g., `airlab ssh <TAB>`) complete from the systems in `$AIRLAB_PATH/robot/robots.yaml`.
*   **Paths:** `airlab sync <robot> --path=<TAB>` and `--exclude=<TAB>` complete with files and directories under `$AIRLAB_PATH`.
*   **Docker containers:** `airlab docker-join --name=<TAB>` completes with currently running Docker container names.
*   **VCS repo files:** `airlab vcs init --repo_file=<TAB>` completes with `.yaml`/`.yml` files (and subdirectories) under `$AIRLAB_PATH/version_control/`.
*   **VCS sub-commands:** `airlab vcs <TAB>` lists `init`, `pull`, `push`, `status`, `update`, `check`, `tag`, and `checkout`, each with their own option completions.

**After installing or upgrading `airlab`**, run the appropriate snippet below so your shell picks up the new completion file. This is also the fix if you ever see stale or missing completions (e.g. `airlab ssh <TAB>` not listing robots after an upgrade):

```bash
# Bash
source /etc/bash_completion.d/airlab

# Zsh — clear the compiled compdump cache and restart the shell
rm -f ~/.zcompdump*
exec zsh
```

The zsh snippet is needed because zsh caches a compiled completion-function table in `~/.zcompdump*`; an upgraded `_airlab` on disk is only picked up after the cache is invalidated (some zsh frameworks like oh-my-zsh / prezto skip the freshness check by default).

## Commands

Once installed, the `airlab` command provides access to a suite of tools for managing your robotic systems.  The `setup` command is particularly crucial, as it initializes the environment before any other commands are used.

---
### Setup

This command configures either the local environment or a remote robot system.

#### Usage

```bash
# Local setup provisions this machine system-wide, so it must run as root:
sudo airlab setup local [--path=<install_path>] [--force]

# Remote setup runs as your normal user (no local sudo) and elevates ON THE ROBOT:
airlab setup <robot_name> [--path=<install_path>] [--force] [--password]
```

#### Options

*   `--path`: Installation directory (default: `~/airlab_ws`)
*   `--force`: Overwrite an existing installation.
*   `--password`: Skip key-based SSH authentication and prompt for a password directly (remote setup only).
*   `<robot_name>`: Robot identifier, as defined in `robots.yaml`.

#### Privileges

*   **Local** (`setup local`) provisions this machine system-wide (system paths,
    packages, the workspace pointer under `/etc/airlab`), so it **must run as root** —
    use `sudo airlab setup local`.
*   **Remote** (`setup <robot_name>`) runs as **your normal user** — its local git/rsync
    steps read *your* repo and use *your* SSH keys, which must not be run as root. It
    elevates only **on the robot**, over SSH, when a step there needs root. Supply that
    robot-side sudo password via `--password`, the `AIRLAB_SUDO_PASSWORD` environment
    variable, or an interactive prompt (the robot's sudo password is used only if the
    robot lacks passwordless sudo).

#### Configuration Files

*   Robot registry: `robots.yaml` in the workspace's `robot` folder.
*   Environment: `airlab.env` (created during setup).
*   Bash config: Updates to `.bashrc`.

#### Quick Examples

```bash
# Local setup (root)
sudo airlab setup local --path=/opt/airlab_ws
sudo airlab setup local --force

# Remote setup (your user; sudo is used only on the robot)
airlab setup robot1 --path=/home/airlab/ws
airlab setup robot1 --force
```

#### Setup Process

##### Local

1.  Creates the necessary directory structure.
2.  Copies configuration files.
3.  Sets environment variables.
4.  Updates `.bashrc`.
5.  Creates `airlab.env`.

##### Remote

1.  Establishes an SSH connection.
2.  Performs environment setup.
3.  Copies necessary files.
4.  Installs required packages.
5.  Updates `.bashrc`.
6.  Configures `/etc/hosts`.

##### Robot Configuration

In `robots.yaml`, add each robot as a system with an `os_user` and a network address:

```yaml
systems:
  - system: robot1
    os_user: airlab
    type: robot
    network_addresses:
      - address_name: default
        ip: 192.45.34.1
        default: true
```

#### Common Issues

1.  "Permission denied": Check permissions on the installation path.
2.  "SSH connection failed": Verify entries in `robots.yaml`.
3.  "Configuration exists": Use `--force` to overwrite.
4.  "Environment not set": Check `airlab.env` and `.bashrc`.

Detailed documentation is available [here](/usr/local/bin/docs/setup.md).

---

### SSH

This command establishes an SSH connection to a remote robot.

#### Usage

```bash
airlab ssh <robot_name> [options]
```

#### Options

*   `--password`: Skip key-based SSH authentication and prompt for a password directly.
*   `--help`: Show help message.

#### Configuration Files

*   Robot registry: `$AIRLAB_PATH/robot/robots.yaml`
*   Robot info: `$AIRLAB_PATH/robot/robot_info.yaml`

#### Quick Examples

```bash
airlab ssh mt001  # SSH into mt001, as defined in robots.yaml
```

#### Dependencies

*   `ssh`
*   `sshpass`

#### Common Issues

1.  "SSH connection failed": Check network connectivity and credentials.
2.  "Workspace not found": Verify the `robot_info.yaml` configuration.

*Note: Further detailed documentation is omitted due to its relative simplicity.*

---

### Auth

Installs a local SSH public key on a remote robot's `authorized_keys` file to enable password-less SSH authentication.

#### Usage

```bash
airlab auth <robot_name>
```

#### Arguments

*   `<robot_name>`: Name of the robot (must be defined in `robots.yaml`).

#### Options

*   `--help`: Show help message.

#### Quick Examples

```bash
airlab auth mt001  # Copy your SSH public key to mt001
```

#### Features

*   Automatically discovers SSH public keys in `~/.ssh/`.
*   If multiple keys exist, presents an interactive selection menu.
*   Checks for duplicate keys before installing (won't add a key that's already present).
*   Verifies key-based SSH authentication works after installation.

#### Dependencies

*   `ssh`
*   `sshpass`

---

### Set_env

Sets environment variables for local or remote robot environments.

#### Usage

```bash
airlab set_env [ROBOT_NAME] [ENV_VARIABLE]
```

#### Arguments

*   `ROBOT_NAME`: Target system (`local` for the local environment).
*   `ENV_VARIABLE`: Environment variable and its value to set.

#### Options

*   `--help`, `-h`: Display help message.

#### Examples

```bash
# Set a local environment variable
airlab set_env local MY_VAR="hello"

# Set a remote robot environment variable
airlab set_env robot1 MY_VAR="hello"
```

#### Features

*   For local execution, updates the local `airlab.env` file.
*   For remote execution, updates both the remote `airlab.env` file and the configuration in `robot_info.yaml`.

*Note: Further detailed documentation is omitted due to its relative simplicity.*

---

### set_hosts

Updates `/etc/hosts` with hostname-to-IP mappings from `robots.yaml`, so you can reach robots by name (e.g., `ping mt001`).

#### Usage

```bash
airlab set_hosts local [--help]

airlab set_hosts <robot_name> [--password] [--help]
```

#### Arguments

*   `local`: Update the local machine's `/etc/hosts`.
*   `<robot_name>`: Update `/etc/hosts` on a remote robot via SSH.

#### Options

*   `--password`: Skip key-based SSH authentication and prompt for a password directly (remote targets only).
*   `--help`: Show help message.

#### Quick Examples

```bash
airlab set_hosts local              # Update local /etc/hosts
airlab set_hosts mt001              # Update /etc/hosts on mt001
airlab set_hosts mt001 --password   # Use password authentication
```

#### Features

*   Reads each robot's `network_addresses` from `robots.yaml`: the default address maps to the robot name, every other address to `<robot>-<address_name>`.
*   Skips any address with no `ip` (it resolves by hostname, not a static IP) or whose composed name isn't a valid hostname, and prints a summary of what was skipped and why.
*   Creates a timestamped backup before modifying `/etc/hosts` (e.g., `/etc/hosts_20260429_160345`).
*   Uses fenced markers (`# Airlab Hosts Start` / `# Airlab Hosts End`) — if markers exist, only the content between them is replaced.
*   Checks for hostname and IP conflicts with existing entries outside the markers. If conflicts are found, warns and aborts.
*   Supports both local and remote targets with full SSH key/password authentication.

#### Dependencies

*   `ssh`, `sshpass` (for remote targets)
*   `sudo` (required to modify `/etc/hosts`)

Detailed documentation is available [here](/usr/local/bin/docs/set_hosts.md).

---

### Sync

This command synchronizes files between the local machine and a remote robot.

#### Usage

```bash
airlab sync <robot_name> [options]
```

#### Options

*   `--dry-run`: Preview the synchronization without making changes.
*   `--delete`: Remove extra files on the remote system.
*   `--path=<relative_path>`: Synchronize a specific directory.
*   `--exclude=<pattern>`: Skip files matching the specified pattern.

#### Quick Examples

```bash
# Basic sync
airlab sync mt001  # Sync all files
airlab sync mt001 --dry-run  # Preview changes
airlab sync mt001 --delete  # Remove extra files

# Advanced sync
airlab sync mt001 --path=src/config  # Sync specific path
airlab sync mt001 --exclude='*.log'  # Skip log files
```

#### Default Exclusions

*   `.git/`, `build/`, `devel/`, `log/`
*   `install/`, `*.pyc`, `__pycache__`
*   `*.env`

#### Dependencies

*   `rsync`

4.  "Time sync failed": Check `sudo` access on the remote system.

Detailed documentation is available [here](/usr/local/bin/docs/sync.md).

---

### Launch

This command launches applications or processes on a robot using `tmux`.

#### Usage

```bash
airlab launch <robot_name> [options]
```

#### Options

*   `<robot_name>`: Name of the robot (must be defined in `robots.yaml`).
*   `--yaml_file=<file_name>`: Alternative launch file (relative to the workspace).
*   `--stop`: Stop the `tmux` session.
*   `--password`: Skip key-based SSH authentication and prompt for a password directly (remote operations only).
*   `--help`: Show help message.

#### Configuration Files

*   Launch files: Set by the `LAUNCH_FILE_PATH` environment variable.
*   Robot registry: `$AIRLAB_PATH/robot/robots.yaml`
*   Robot info: `$AIRLAB_PATH/robot/robot_info.yaml`

#### Quick Examples

# Local operations
airlab launch local  # Launch locally
airlab launch local --stop  # Stop local session

# Remote operations
airlab launch mt001  # Launch on mt001
airlab launch mt001 --stop  # Stop on mt001
airlab launch mt001 --yaml_file=mt002.yaml  # Launch specific yaml on mt001
```

#### Dependencies

*   `tmuxp`
*   `ssh`
*   `python3` (with PyYAML)
*   `sshpass` (for remote operations)

#### Common Issues

1.  "YAML file not found": Check the `LAUNCH_FILE_PATH` environment variable.
2.  "System not found": Verify the robot name in `robots.yaml`.
3.  "Cannot connect": Check network and SSH credentials.
4.  "Failed to get workspace": Verify entries in `robot_info.yaml`.

Note: Use `local` as the robot name for local operations. YAML file paths should be relative to the robot's workspace.

Detailed documentation is available [here](/usr/local/bin/docs/launch.md).

### Docker Commands

This section outlines commands related to managing Docker containers and images. These commands are basically a wrapper around docker. I don't think they are that useful tbh. I tried to use docker context but it is tricky to deal with!

#### docker-build

Builds Docker images locally or remotely. 

##### Usage

```bash
airlab docker-build [OPTIONS]
```

##### Options

*   `--system=<system_name>`: Target system for remote operations.
*   `--compose=<compose_file>`: Docker Compose file (relative to robot workspace. Defaults to `$DOCKER_BUILD_PATH`).
*   `--password`: Skip key-based SSH authentication and prompt for a password directly.
*   `--help`: Display help message.

#### docker-list

Lists Docker containers or images.

##### Usage

```bash
airlab docker-list [OPTIONS]
```

##### Options

*   `--system=<system_name>`: Target system for remote operations.
*   `--images`: List images instead of containers.
*   `--password`: Skip key-based SSH authentication and prompt for a password directly.
*   `--help`: Display help message.

#### docker-join

Joins a running container with an interactive shell.

##### Usage

```bash
airlab docker-join [OPTIONS]
```

##### Options

*   `--system=<system_name>`: Target system for remote operations.
*   `--name=<container_name>`: Container to join.
*   `--password`: Skip key-based SSH authentication and prompt for a password directly.
*   `--help`: Display help message.

#### docker-up

Starts containers using Docker Compose.

##### Usage

```bash
airlab docker-up [OPTIONS]
```

##### Options

*   `--system=<system_name>`: Target system for remote operations.
*   `--compose=<compose_file>`: Docker Compose file (relative to the robot workspace. Defaults to `$DOCKER_UP_PATH`).
*   `--password`: Skip key-based SSH authentication and prompt for a password directly.
*   `--help`: Display help message.

#### docker-clean

Stops and removes **all** Docker containers (running or stopped) on the local machine or a remote robot. Equivalent to `docker stop $(docker ps -a -q) && docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)`, but no-ops cleanly when there are no containers. Prompts for confirmation by default since this is destructive.

##### Usage

```bash
airlab docker-clean [OPTIONS]
```

##### Options

*   `--system=<system_name>`: Target system for remote operations.
*   `--yes`, `-y`: Skip the confirmation prompt.
*   `--password`: Skip key-based SSH authentication and prompt for a password directly.
*   `--help`: Display help message.

##### Quick Examples

```bash
airlab docker-clean                  # local, with confirmation
airlab docker-clean --yes            # local, no prompt
airlab docker-clean --system=mt001   # clean every container on mt001
```

#### Common Features

*   **Remote Operations**: Requires a valid system definition in `robots.yaml`, SSH credentials, and correct configuration in `robot_info.yaml`.
*   **Error Handling**: Employs colored error messages and performs validation before executing operations.
*   **Dependencies**: `docker`, `docker-compose`, `ssh`, `sshpass`.
*   **Environment**: Requires `$DOCKER_BUILD_PATH` and `$DOCKER_UP_PATH` to be set.

Detailed documentation is available [here](/usr/local/bin/docs/docker-commands.md).

---

### ros2

Pass-through wrapper that runs an arbitrary `ros2` sub-command inside a transient Docker container, then stops and removes the container when the command exits (via `docker run --rm`). Intended for quick one-shots — bag inspection, topic/node/param introspection, `doctor` — not for replacing the long-running compose workflow.

`--network=host` is set so DDS discovery reaches nodes already running on the host, and `/opt/ros/*/setup.bash` is sourced inside the container (so it works on CUDA-base images that don't put `ros2` on `PATH`). A TTY is allocated only when both stdin and stdout are terminals, so piping works.

#### Usage

```bash
airlab ros2 [--image=<image>] <ros2-command> [args...]
```

Wrapper-specific flags must appear **before** the `ros2` sub-command. Once a non-wrapper token is seen, every remaining argument is passed through to `ros2` inside the container — so `airlab ros2 bag --help` forwards `--help` to `ros2 bag`, not to the wrapper.

#### Wrapper Options

*   `--image=<image>`: Use a specific Docker image. Default: the value of `AIRLAB_DEFAULT_IMAGE` from your `airlab.env`.
*   `--help`: Show the wrapper's help message.

#### Environment (set in `$AIRLAB_PATH/airlab.env`)

*   `AIRLAB_DEFAULT_IMAGE`: Docker image to run. **Required** (via this var or `--image=`); machine-specific, e.g. `x86-final:basestation`. If unset/empty and no `--image=` is given, the command errors and tells you to set it.
*   `AIRLAB_DEFAULT_DOCKER_VOLUMES`: Space-separated list of host folders to bind-mount into the container (may be empty). When non-empty, **every** folder must exist and be writable by your user, or the command errors and does not start a container.

#### Volumes

Always mounted (same path inside and out): `$AIRLAB_PATH`, the current working directory (`-w $PWD`), plus each folder in `AIRLAB_DEFAULT_DOCKER_VOLUMES`. The workspace `airlab.env` is **resolved on the host** and its variables are injected into the container (via `--env-file`), so lazy references like `${HOME}`, `${USER}`, and `$(id -gn)` expand against *you*, not the container's identity.

#### DDS middleware / RMW

The wrapper does not force a middleware. Set `RMW_IMPLEMENTATION` in `airlab.env` to choose one (it is exported into the container). The container does **not** inherit your host shell, so setting it only in your terminal has no effect — put it in `airlab.env` (or the image's own `ENV`). The image must contain the matching RMW package, and every participant on the network must use the same RMW/domain to communicate over `--network=host`.

For RTI Connext (`RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_connextdds`), the RMW is an overlay that needs its own setup sourced on top of the base ROS environment. When that RMW is selected, the wrapper automatically sources it — default `/opt/rmw_connextdds/install/setup.bash`, overridable with `AIRLAB_ROS2_CONNEXT_SETUP`. If the file is absent, it warns and continues (so `ros2`'s own error surfaces).

#### Quick Examples

```bash
airlab ros2 bag info ./recording                # inspect a bag in the current dir
airlab ros2 topic list                          # list topics on the host
airlab ros2 --image=x86-final:basestation \
    run my_pkg my_node                          # pin a specific image
airlab ros2 topic list | grep tf                # pipes cleanly (no TTY error)
```

#### Dependencies

*   `docker`
*   A Docker image, via `AIRLAB_DEFAULT_IMAGE` or `--image=`.

### VCS Commands

This section describes commands for interacting with version control systems. This is based on [vcstool](https://github.com/dirk-thomas/vcstool) which is developed by Thomas Dirk. These tools lets you deal with multiple repositories at the same time.

#### init

Initializes local repositories based on a YAML configuration.

##### Usage

```bash
airlab vcs init [OPTIONS]
```

##### Options

*   `--repo_file=FILE`: YAML file (default: `repos.yaml`).
*   `--path=DIR`: Local directory. If not specified, the directory from the YAML file is used.
*   `--all`: Apply the operation to all YAML files in the version-control directory.
*   `--here`: Re-initialize repos in the current directory using its `AIRLAB_REPO_FILE`.
*   `--here --check`: Compare the current directory structure against the YAML.
*   `--here --from-scratch`: Delete all YAML-defined repo folders and re-clone from scratch.
*   `--entry=NAME`: Only initialize a single repository entry from the YAML file.
*   `--help`: Display help message.

#### pull

Pulls changes from remote repositories to the local workspace.

##### Usage

```bash
airlab vcs pull [OPTIONS]
```

##### Options

*   `--no-rebase`: Disable rebasing.
*   `--help`: Display help message.

#### push

Pushes local changes to remote repositories. With `--tags=<name>`, pushes a single named tag instead of branch refs, deduplicated by remote URL with the same drift gate as [`tag --push`](#tag).

##### Usage

```bash
airlab vcs push [OPTIONS]
```

##### Options

*   `--tags=<name>`: Push the named tag (instead of branch refs). Walks the current directory, finds git repositories (skipping submodules), groups them by normalized remote URL, and runs `git push origin refs/tags/<name>` once per unique URL. Refuses if any group's clones have the tag pointing at different commits, unless `--force` is also given.
*   `--force`: With `--tags=`, overwrite the remote tag and skip the drift gate.
*   `--dry-run`: With `--tags=`, show what would be pushed without actually pushing.
*   `--help`: Display help message.

##### Quick Examples

```bash
airlab vcs push                       # push branch refs (vcstool default)
airlab vcs push --tags=v1.0.0         # push tag v1.0.0, deduped by URL
airlab vcs push --tags=v1.0.0 --dry-run
airlab vcs push --tags=v1.0.0 --force # overwrite remote, skip drift gate
```

#### status

Displays the status of local repositories.

##### Usage

```bash
airlab vcs status [OPTIONS]
```

##### Options

*   `--help`: Display help message.
* `--show-branch`: Show the current branch of the repository

#### update

Updates repositories by pulling latest changes and initializing any new repos. Must be run from a directory containing `AIRLAB_REPO_FILE`.

##### Usage

```bash
airlab vcs update [OPTIONS]
```

##### Options

*   `--help`: Display help message.

##### Steps

1.  Pull all existing repos (stops on first failure).
2.  Run `airlab vcs init --here` to clone any missing repos.
3.  Pull all repos again (collects failures and shows a summary).

#### check

Find repository drift in two complementary modes. Run before `airlab vcs tag` to make sure shared clones agree.

##### Usage

```bash
airlab vcs check [OPTIONS]
```

##### Modes

*   **Default (filesystem mode):** Walks the current directory recursively, finds every git repository (skipping submodules and linked worktrees), groups them by normalized remote URL, and flags any group whose clones are not all on the same commit. Equivalent ssh and https URLs collapse to the same group. Output is split into `[DRIFT]` (red), `[BRANCH SKEW]` (yellow), `[OK]` (green), `[NO ORIGIN]`, and `[DIRTY]` sections.
*   **`--version-control` mode:** Reads every YAML file under `$AIRLAB_PATH/version_control/`. Flags any URL pinned to multiple `version:` values across YAMLs (`[VERSION DRIFT]`) and any duplicate URLs within a single YAML (`[DUPLICATE URL]`).

##### Options

*   `--version-control`: Scan YAMLs in `$AIRLAB_PATH/version_control/` instead of walking PWD.
*   `--no-progress`: Disable the progress bar (also auto-disabled when stderr is not a terminal).
*   `--help`: Display help message.

##### Exit Codes

*   `0`: No drift / no duplicates found.
*   `1`: Drift, duplicate URLs, or YAML parse errors detected — usable in scripts and CI.

##### Quick Examples

```bash
airlab cd && airlab vcs check         # walk the workspace, flag commit drift
airlab vcs check --version-control    # cross-YAML version drift + intra-YAML dupes
airlab vcs check --no-progress        # piped/CI-friendly run
```

#### tag

Recursively create a git tag at HEAD of every repository under the current directory, skipping submodules. Optionally push the tag to origin once per unique remote URL (deduplicated, with a drift gate).

##### Usage

```bash
airlab vcs tag <tag_name> [OPTIONS]
```

##### Arguments

*   `<tag_name>`: Name of the tag to create (e.g. `v1.0.0`).

##### Options

*   `-m, --message=<msg>`: Annotated tag message. Default: `airlab vcs tag <name> on <ISO date>`.
*   `--lightweight`: Create a lightweight tag (no message). Mutually exclusive with `-m` / `--message`.
*   `--force`: Overwrite an existing local tag. With `--push`, also overwrites the remote tag and skips the drift gate.
*   `--push`: After tagging, push the tag to origin once per unique remote URL. Refuses to push if shared clones are not on the same commit, unless `--force` is also set. The repository with the lexicographically smallest path is chosen as the source for each push.
*   `--dry-run`: Print what would be done without making any changes.
*   `--no-progress`: Disable the progress bar (also auto-disabled when stderr is not a terminal).
*   `--help`: Display help message.

##### Behavior

*   Annotated tags by default; the auto-generated message records the tag name and an ISO-8601 UTC timestamp.
*   A dirty working tree triggers a `[WARN]` line but does not block tagging — the tag attaches to whatever HEAD currently points at.
*   With `--push`, a repo cloned in N workspaces is pushed exactly once. The drift gate refuses publication if the same logical repo has different SHAs across workspaces.

##### Recommended Workflow

```bash
airlab cd
airlab vcs check                      # confirm no [DRIFT]
airlab vcs tag v1.0.0 --push          # tag everything and publish, deduped
```

If you want to tag now and push later:

```bash
airlab vcs tag v1.0.0
airlab vcs push --tags=v1.0.0
```

##### Quick Examples

```bash
airlab vcs tag v1.0.0                                # annotated tag, no push
airlab vcs tag v1.0.0 --message="release 1.0"        # custom message
airlab vcs tag v1.0.0 --lightweight                  # lightweight tag
airlab vcs tag v1.0.0 --push                         # tag + dedup-push
airlab vcs tag v1.0.0 --push --force                 # overwrite remote tag
airlab vcs tag v1.0.0 --dry-run                      # preview only
```

#### `airlab vcs checkout <ref>` — Recursive Branch / Tag Checkout

Recursively run `git checkout <ref>` in every repository under the current directory, skipping submodules. `<ref>` may be a branch or tag. After each checkout, the new state is summarized in a colored table.

##### Usage

```bash
airlab vcs checkout <ref> [OPTIONS]
```

##### Arguments

*   `<ref>`: Branch or tag name to check out.

##### Options

*   `--no-fetch`: Skip `git fetch --tags origin` before checkout. Faster, but tag availability and ahead/behind counts may be stale.
*   `--force`, `-f`: Pass `-f` to `git checkout`, discarding local uncommitted changes. Use with care.
*   `--no-progress`: Disable the progress bar (also auto-disabled when stderr is not a terminal).
*   `--help`: Display help message.

##### Behavior

*   Walks PWD with the same logic as `airlab vcs check` (skips submodules and linked worktrees).
*   Fetches `--tags` from `origin` per repo unless `--no-fetch` (so tag availability and ahead/behind are accurate).
*   If `<ref>` exists on `origin` but not yet locally, git's DWIM creates a tracking branch.
*   If `<ref>` is a tag, the result is a detached HEAD (reported as `on tag`).
*   If `<ref>` does not exist on the repo (no local branch, no tag, no `origin/<ref>`), the row reports `ref MISSING`.
*   Dirty trees that would be clobbered are reported as `FAILED (dirty)` and skipped; `--force` overrides.
*   After each successful checkout, ahead/behind upstream is computed (when on a branch with tracking), and submodule SHA changes are counted.

##### Output

Per-repo row colored by status:

*   **green** `ok` — checked out, on ref, up to date (or no remote to compare).
*   **yellow** `warn` — checked out but ahead/behind upstream, or submodule SHAs changed.
*   **red** `err` — `ref MISSING`, `FAILED`, `FAILED (dirty)`, or `fetch FAILED`.

Rows are sorted err → warn → ok. A summary line counts each status bucket. Exit code is 0 only when every row is `ok`.

##### Quick Examples

```bash
airlab vcs checkout main                  # branch checkout in every repo (fetches first)
airlab vcs checkout v1.0.0                # tag checkout; missing-tag repos are flagged
airlab vcs checkout strapsai/main         # also a branch — pulled from origin if needed
airlab vcs checkout main --no-fetch       # already fetched recently, skip
airlab vcs checkout main --force          # discard local uncommitted changes
```

#### Progress Bar

`vcs check` (filesystem mode), `vcs tag`, and `vcs checkout` show a progress bar on stderr during their silent phases — the directory walk and the per-repo `git` invocations. Across hundreds of repositories these phases would otherwise look hung.

```
[████████░░░░░░░░░░░░] 145/347  inspecting: ws/src/path/to/repo
```

*   Stderr only, so piped/redirected stdout stays clean.
*   Auto-disabled when stderr is not a TTY.
*   `--no-progress` flag forces it off even on a TTY (useful in CI / scripts).
*   The tag and push **execution** loops are not wrapped — they already emit one `✓` / `✗` line per repository.

#### Common Features

*   **Error Handling**: Employs colored error messages and performs validation before executing operations.
*   **Dependencies**: `git`, `vcstool`, `bash`.
*   **Environment**: Requires `$AIRLAB_PATH` to be set.

Detailed documentation is available [here](/usr/local/bin/docs/version-control-commands.md).

### cd

This command changes the current working directory to a path relative to `$AIRLAB_PATH`. It works like the standard `cd` command but always starts from the airlab workspace root.

> **Note:** `airlab cd` is implemented as a shell function (not a standalone script) because a subprocess cannot change the parent shell's working directory. In Bash, the function is loaded from the completion script at `/etc/bash_completion.d/airlab`. In Zsh, it is loaded from `/etc/airlab/airlab.zsh` (sourced via `~/.zshrc`).

#### Usage

```bash
airlab cd [path]
```

#### Arguments

*   `path`: A directory path relative to `$AIRLAB_PATH`. If omitted, changes to `$AIRLAB_PATH` itself.

#### Quick Examples

```bash
airlab cd                   # cd to $AIRLAB_PATH
airlab cd docker            # cd to $AIRLAB_PATH/docker
airlab cd robot             # cd to $AIRLAB_PATH/robot
airlab cd version_control   # cd to $AIRLAB_PATH/version_control
```

#### Tab Completion

`airlab cd <TAB>` lists directories under `$AIRLAB_PATH`, and supports nested path completion (e.g., `airlab cd docker/<TAB>`).

### Alias Commands (`airlab a`)

Run user-defined commands ("verbs") that you author as plain scripts — perfect for wrapping a long `ansible-playbook` invocation, a multi-step recovery, or any procedure into one short, tab-completable, shareable command.

An alias is a `.sh` or `.py` file under one of the colon-separated directories in **`$AIRLAB_ALIAS_PATH`** (default: `$AIRLAB_PATH/alias`). The command name is the file path relative to its alias dir, with the extension dropped and folders kept as a slash-nested hierarchy:

```
$AIRLAB_ALIAS_PATH/fleet/build.sh   →   airlab a fleet/build
```

#### Usage

```bash
airlab a                       # list all aliases (name, @desc, @author)
airlab a fleet/build           # run the fleet/build alias
airlab a fleet/build --help    # show that alias's own help
airlab a --new fleet/deploy    # scaffold a new bash alias (--py for Python)
airlab a --lint                # lint all aliases (used by CI)
```

#### How aliases run

*   On the **local machine**, in your **current directory**, with `airlab.env` and the airlab venv already active — so an alias can call other `airlab` verbs and read `$AIRLAB_PATH`.
*   Exit code is passed through. **All arguments after the alias name are forwarded to the alias** (it parses its own flags, including `--help`) — e.g. `airlab a fleet/sync spirit-nx3 --cleanup`.
*   These variables are exported for the alias: `AIRLAB_ALIAS_SELF` (its path), `AIRLAB_ALIAS_DIR` (its folder — handy for finding a file bundled beside it), `AIRLAB_ALIAS_NAME`.

#### Authoring contract

Every alias must declare two header comments and handle `--help`:

```bash
# @desc: build all workspaces on this host   # one-line description (shown by 'airlab a')
# @author: Your Name <handle>                # owner — assign PRs to them when tweaking
```

`airlab a --new <name>` scaffolds a compliant file from the bundled template. `airlab a --lint [PATH...]` checks that every alias has `@desc`, `@author`, and a `--help` handler — wire it into CI in the repo that hosts your alias directory.

#### Resolution & collisions

`$AIRLAB_ALIAS_PATH` is searched left-to-right; the first directory that owns a name wins. Within that directory, a name that resolves to both `.sh` and `.py`, or to both a file and a sub-directory, is a **collision** — `airlab a` reports it and refuses to run until you disambiguate.

#### Tab Completion

`airlab a <TAB>` lists alias names (sub-groups shown with a trailing `/`, leaf aliases with the extension stripped) and supports nested completion (e.g. `airlab a fleet/<TAB>`).

See [`usr/local/bin/docs/alias-commands.md`](usr/local/bin/docs/alias-commands.md) for the full reference.

## Workspace Structure

### Overview

This workspace design is intended to simplify integration and operation of robotic systems utilizing ROS 2 and Docker. The workspace is structured into folders dedicated to specific tasks, ensuring efficient management of configurations, dependencies, and runtime environments and enabling a smooth and scalable development process.

### Directory Structure

The workspace follows this hierarchical structure:

```
workspace/
│
├── docker/
│   ├── sample.dockerfile            # Dockerfile to build the container
│   ├── docker-compose.yml           # Compose file to manage multiple containers
│
├── launch/
│   ├── sample.yaml                 # Launch file for starting nodes or systems
│
├── robot/
│   ├── robots.yaml                 # Robot registry: systems + network addresses
│   ├── robot_info.yaml             # System-generated YAML file containing robot information
│
├── version_control/
│   ├── repos.yaml                  # Sample repositories for version control using git
│
└── airlab.env                      # Environment file for airlab command settings
```

### Folder Breakdown

#### docker/

This folder contains all Docker-related files, including the **Dockerfile** and **docker-compose.yml**, which are essential for setting up the containerized environment.

-   **sample.dockerfile**: The primary Dockerfile used to build the robot's container.
-   **docker-compose.yml**: A Docker Compose file for managing multi-container setups, which simplifies running and scaling multiple services or systems simultaneously.

##### Usage:

-   Add additional Dockerfiles and compose files to this directory as needed. Ensure that any changes align with the standard structure and naming conventions.

#### launch/

This folder holds all **launch** files in the [tmuxp format](https://github.com/tmux-python/tmuxp), a powerful tool for managing tmux sessions programmatically. Launch files specify the startup procedures for nodes or systems and are crucial for orchestrating the robot's operational flow.

-   **sample.yaml**: A sample launch file configured to use tmuxp format for managing multi-session tmux setups.

##### Usage:

-   Add new launch files as needed, ensuring that they follow the tmuxp format to maintain consistency and compatibility.

#### robot/

This folder contains the configuration files that define robot-specific settings and metadata. It is essential for ensuring that the robot's environment is properly configured and that the system can integrate various robots into the workspace.

-   **robots.yaml**: The robot registry — defines each remote system, its `os_user`/`type`, and one or more named `network_addresses` (a `default`, plus optional ones like `internet`/`vpn`), each with an `ip` and/or `hostname`:

    ```yaml
    systems:
      - system: mt001
        os_user: dtc
        type: robot
        network_addresses:
          - address_name: default
            ip: 10.223.1.99
            default: true
    ```

    `airlab` resolves a robot's SSH address (and named `--address` values) from here.

-   **robot_info.yaml**: A dynamically generated YAML file that contains detailed information about the robots in the system, including metadata such as IP addresses, usernames, and robot models.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    spot1:
      ws_path: "/home/airlab/airlab_ws"
      robot_ssh: "airlab@10.3.1.14"
      last_updated: "2024-12-22 19:48:31"
    ```

##### Usage:

-   The **robot_info.yaml** file is automatically updated by the `airlab` command to reflect the latest robot configurations.
-   The **robots.yaml** file is manually maintained — add new robots (and their network addresses) here as they join the fleet.

#### version_control/

This folder is responsible for managing the version control configurations for the repositories used in the project. It utilizes [python-vcstool](https://github.com/dirk-thomas/vcstool) to streamline version management and facilitate easy integration of external repositories.

-   **repos.yaml**: This file lists all the repositories required for the project. The file follows the vcs format supported by vcstool. Each repository is defined by its type, URL, and the version/branch to be used.

    Example format:

    ```yaml
    dir: src
    repositories:
      vcstool:
        type: git
        url: git@github.com:dirk-thomas/vcstool.git
        version: master
    ```

    In this example, `type` specifies the version control system (e.g., `git`), `url` provides the repository location, and `version` refers to the branch (e.g., `master`).
    The path provided to the dir is relative to the workspace_path.

##### Usage:

-   Regularly update the **repos.yaml** file to add new repositories, update existing ones, or change versions to ensure your workspace stays synchronized with the latest code and dependencies.
- You can also add other yaml files to **version_control/** for specific purposes.

#### airlab.env

The **airlab.env** file configures the environment variables and runtime settings specific to the `airlab` command. It is essential for ensuring that the necessary paths, configurations, and system parameters are set up correctly.

##### Key points:

-   This file defines system paths, environment variables, and settings unique to the robot's workspace.
-   **airlab.env** is **system-specific** and **not synchronized** when you run the sync or setup commands. This means each system or robot may have a different configuration.

##### Usage:

-   Make sure to configure this file correctly for each system to ensure that the `airlab` command functions as expected.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: You are welcome to rename or create new files as needed, but **please do not modify the folder structure**. Renaming or deleting folders like `docker/` or altering their names may cause the tool to malfunction and prevent it from working properly.

## Future Work

This was a weekend project through which I learned scripting. I would love new ideas that we can add here. It should probably be adding ROS2 functionality to the tool!
