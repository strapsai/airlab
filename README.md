# Airlab: Simplified Deployment for Robotic Systems


`airlab` is a command-line tool designed to streamline and simplify deployment workflows for robotic systems, both locally and remotely.  It unifies common tasks such as file synchronization, launch file management, and environment configuration by integrating industry-standard tools like `rsync`, `docker`, and `tmux` under a single, consistent interface.  This reduces complexity and accelerates development and deployment cycles, making `airlab` an invaluable asset for robotics engineers and developers.

## Key Features

*   **File Synchronization:**  Provides an easy and efficient method for transferring files between local and remote systems.
*   **Launch Management:** Simplifies the process of launching and managing robotic system launch files, especially using `tmux` sessions.
*   **Environment Setup:** Automates the configuration of necessary environments on remote systems.
*   **Multi-Repository Workflows:** Beyond `vcstool`'s init/pull/push/status, the `vcs` family also supports cross-workspace **drift detection** (`airlab vcs check`) and **recursive tagging with deduplicated push** (`airlab vcs tag`), which is essential when the same source repository is cloned across many sub-workspaces.
*   **Unified Interface:** Consolidates various tools and processes into a single command-line utility.
*   **Debian Package:**  Offers a simple and reliable installation and update mechanism via a Debian package.

## Installation

`airlab` is intended to be installed on the host machine from which you control remote robotic systems. Remote systems are then configured using the `setup` command.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Docker Engine:**  Install Docker Engine using the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#installation-methods).

2.  **NVIDIA Container Toolkit:** Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit according to the [official NVIDIA documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html). This also requires the CUDA Toolkit and NVIDIA Driver, which can be found [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kabirkedia/airlab.git
    ```

2.  **Run the install script:**

    ```bash
    cd airlab
    ./install.sh
    ```

    The install script handles the full installation process:
    -   Installs apt dependencies (`python3-pip`, `python3-venv`, etc.)
    -   Creates a Python virtual environment at `~/VENVs/airlab`
    -   Installs Python dependencies (`pyyaml`, `vcstool`, etc.)
    -   Builds and installs the `airlab` Debian package

    **Virtual environment options:**

    If the `~/VENVs/airlab` virtual environment already exists, the script will prompt you to remove and re-create it or keep the existing one. You can also control this behavior with command-line flags:

    ```bash
    # Always remove and re-create the venv (no prompt)
    ./install.sh --override-venv

    # Error out if the venv already exists (no prompt)
    ./install.sh --no-override-venv

    # Skip venv creation entirely — use whatever venv is currently active
    ./install.sh --skip-venv
    ```

    The `--skip-venv` option is useful when you manage your own virtual environment (e.g., conda, poetry, or a shared team venv). It requires that a virtual environment is already active in the current terminal session. Python dependencies will be installed into that active venv instead of creating `~/VENVs/airlab`.

    **Skip apt installs:**

    If you've already installed the apt dependencies (or want to manage them yourself), use `--skip-apt` to skip both `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt install` in `install.sh` and `install_dependencies_ubuntu24.sh`:

    ```bash
    ./install.sh --skip-apt
    ```

    This flag can be combined with the venv flags, e.g., `./install.sh --skip-venv --skip-apt`.

3.  **(Optional) Install Missing Dependencies:** This command can attempt to fix broken installations by installing missing dependencies. While it can be helpful, it's generally more reliable to ensure all prerequisites are installed beforehand.

    ```bash
    sudo apt install -f -y
    ```

### Post-Installation Notes
After installing airlab you can run the command to setup the environment `airlab setup local or <robot>`

### Tab Auto-Completion

`airlab` ships with tab-completion for both **Bash** and **Zsh** out of the box.

**Bash:** The completion script is installed to `/etc/bash_completion.d/airlab` as part of the Debian package and is automatically sourced by new shell sessions.

**Zsh:** The completion function is installed to `/usr/share/zsh/vendor-completions/_airlab` and is automatically discovered by zsh's completion system. The `airlab` shell function (needed for `airlab cd`) is installed to `/etc/airlab/airlab.zsh` and sourced from `~/.zshrc` during installation.

**What it completes:**

*   **Sub-commands:** `airlab <TAB>` lists all available commands (`setup`, `ssh`, `sync`, `vcs`, etc.).
*   **Options and flags:** `airlab sync mt001 <TAB>` lists `--dry-run`, `--delete`, `--path=`, `--exclude=`, etc.
*   **Robot names:** Commands that take a robot name (e.g., `airlab ssh <TAB>`) complete from the entries in `$AIRLAB_PATH/robot/robot.conf`.
*   **Paths:** `airlab sync <robot> --path=<TAB>` and `--exclude=<TAB>` complete with files and directories under `$AIRLAB_PATH`.
*   **Docker containers:** `airlab docker-join --name=<TAB>` completes with currently running Docker container names.
*   **VCS repo files:** `airlab vcs init --repo_file=<TAB>` completes with `.yaml`/`.yml` files (and subdirectories) under `$AIRLAB_PATH/version_control/`.
*   **VCS sub-commands:** `airlab vcs <TAB>` lists `init`, `pull`, `push`, `status`, `update`, `check`, and `tag`, each with their own option completions.

To manually reload the completion script (e.g., during development):

```bash
# Bash
source /etc/bash_completion.d/airlab

# Zsh (clear cache and restart)
rm -f ~/.zcompdump*
exec zsh
```

## Commands

Once installed, the `airlab` command provides access to a suite of tools for managing your robotic systems.  The `setup` command is particularly crucial, as it initializes the environment before any other commands are used.

---
### Setup

This command configures either the local environment or a remote robot system.

#### Usage

```bash
airlab setup local [--path=<install_path>] [--force]

airlab setup <robot_name> [--path=<install_path>] [--force] [--password]
```

#### Options

*   `--path`: Installation directory (default: `~/airlab_ws`)
*   `--force`: Overwrite an existing installation.
*   `--password`: Skip key-based SSH authentication and prompt for a password directly (remote setup only).
*   `<robot_name>`: Robot identifier, as defined in `robot.conf`.

#### Configuration Files

*   Robot config: `robot.conf` in the workspace's `robot` folder.
*   Environment: `airlab.env` (created during setup).
*   Bash config: Updates to `.bashrc`.

#### Quick Examples

```bash
# Local setup
airlab setup local --path=/opt/airlab_ws
airlab setup local --force

# Remote setup
airlab setup robot1 --path=/home/airlab/ws
airlab setup robot1 --force
```

#### Setup Process

##### Local

1.  Creates the necessary directory structure.
2.  Copies configuration files.
3.  Sets environment variables.
4.  Updates `.bashrc`.
5.  Creates `airlab.env`.

##### Remote

1.  Establishes an SSH connection.
2.  Performs environment setup.
3.  Copies necessary files.
4.  Installs required packages.
5.  Updates `.bashrc`.
6.  Configures `/etc/hosts`.

##### Robot Configuration

In `robot.conf`:

```bash
robot1=airlab@192.45.34.1
robot2=airlab@192.45.34.2
```

#### Common Issues

1.  "Permission denied": Check permissions on the installation path.
2.  "SSH connection failed": Verify entries in `robot.conf`.
3.  "Configuration exists": Use `--force` to overwrite.
4.  "Environment not set": Check `airlab.env` and `.bashrc`.

Detailed documentation is available [here](/usr/local/bin/docs/setup.md).

---

### SSH

This command establishes an SSH connection to a remote robot.

#### Usage

```bash
airlab ssh <robot_name> [options]
```

#### Options

*   `--password`: Skip key-based SSH authentication and prompt for a password directly.
*   `--help`: Show help message.

#### Configuration Files

*   Robot config: `$AIRLAB_PATH/robot/robot.conf`
*   Robot info: `$AIRLAB_PATH/robot/robot_info.yaml`

#### Quick Examples

```bash
airlab ssh mt001  # SSH into mt001, as defined in robot.conf
```

#### Dependencies

*   `ssh`
*   `sshpass`

#### Common Issues

1.  "SSH connection failed": Check network connectivity and credentials.
2.  "Workspace not found": Verify the `robot_info.yaml` configuration.

*Note: Further detailed documentation is omitted due to its relative simplicity.*

---

### Auth

Installs a local SSH public key on a remote robot's `authorized_keys` file to enable password-less SSH authentication.

#### Usage

```bash
airlab auth <robot_name>
```

#### Arguments

*   `<robot_name>`: Name of the robot (must be defined in `robot.conf`).

#### Options

*   `--help`: Show help message.

#### Quick Examples

```bash
airlab auth mt001  # Copy your SSH public key to mt001
```

#### Features

*   Automatically discovers SSH public keys in `~/.ssh/`.
*   If multiple keys exist, presents an interactive selection menu.
*   Checks for duplicate keys before installing (won't add a key that's already present).
*   Verifies key-based SSH authentication works after installation.

#### Dependencies

*   `ssh`
*   `sshpass`

---

### Set_env

Sets environment variables for local or remote robot environments.

#### Usage

```bash
airlab set_env [ROBOT_NAME] [ENV_VARIABLE]
```

#### Arguments

*   `ROBOT_NAME`: Target system (`local` for the local environment).
*   `ENV_VARIABLE`: Environment variable and its value to set.

#### Options

*   `--help`, `-h`: Display help message.

#### Examples

```bash
# Set a local environment variable
airlab set_env local MY_VAR="hello"

# Set a remote robot environment variable
airlab set_env robot1 MY_VAR="hello"
```

#### Features

*   For local execution, updates the local `airlab.env` file.
*   For remote execution, updates both the remote `airlab.env` file and the configuration in `robot_info.yaml`.

*Note: Further detailed documentation is omitted due to its relative simplicity.*

---

### set_hosts

Updates `/etc/hosts` with hostname-to-IP mappings from `robot.conf`, so you can reach robots by name (e.g., `ping mt001`).

#### Usage

```bash
airlab set_hosts local [--help]

airlab set_hosts <robot_name> [--password] [--help]
```

#### Arguments

*   `local`: Update the local machine's `/etc/hosts`.
*   `<robot_name>`: Update `/etc/hosts` on a remote robot via SSH.

#### Options

*   `--password`: Skip key-based SSH authentication and prompt for a password directly (remote targets only).
*   `--help`: Show help message.

#### Quick Examples

```bash
airlab set_hosts local              # Update local /etc/hosts
airlab set_hosts mt001              # Update /etc/hosts on mt001
airlab set_hosts mt001 --password   # Use password authentication
```

#### Features

*   Reads `robot.conf` entries and generates `/etc/hosts` lines mapping robot names to their IPs.
*   Skips `ssh://` URI entries (e.g., `ssh://user@host:port` for port-forwarded connections), since they share a single hostname with different ports and don't map to unique IPs.
*   Creates a timestamped backup before modifying `/etc/hosts` (e.g., `/etc/hosts_20260429_160345`).
*   Uses fenced markers (`# Airlab Hosts Start` / `# Airlab Hosts End`) — if markers exist, only the content between them is replaced.
*   Checks for hostname and IP conflicts with existing entries outside the markers. If conflicts are found, warns and aborts.
*   Supports both local and remote targets with full SSH key/password authentication.

#### Dependencies

*   `ssh`, `sshpass` (for remote targets)
*   `sudo` (required to modify `/etc/hosts`)

Detailed documentation is available [here](/usr/local/bin/docs/set_hosts.md).

---

### Sync

This command synchronizes files between the local machine and a remote robot.

#### Usage

```bash
airlab sync <robot_name> [options]
```

#### Options

*   `--dry-run`: Preview the synchronization without making changes.
*   `--delete`: Remove extra files on the remote system.
*   `--path=<relative_path>`: Synchronize a specific directory.
*   `--exclude=<pattern>`: Skip files matching the specified pattern.
*   `--time`: Synchronize system time.
*   `--progress`: Show progress during the sync operation (useful for large transfers).
*   `--password`: Skip key-based SSH authentication and prompt for a password directly.
*   `--help`: Show help message.

#### Configuration Files

*   Robot config: `$AIRLAB_PATH/robot/robot.conf`
*   Robot info: `$AIRLAB_PATH/robot/robot_info.yaml`

#### Quick Examples

```bash
# Basic sync
airlab sync mt001  # Sync all files

4.  "Time sync failed": Check `sudo` access on the remote system.

Detailed documentation is available [here](/usr/local/bin/docs/sync.md).

---

### Launch

This command launches applications or processes on a robot using `tmux`.

#### Usage

```bash
airlab launch <robot_name> [options]
```

#### Options

*   `<robot_name>`: Name of the robot (must be defined in `robot.conf`).
*   `--yaml_file=<file_name>`: Alternative launch file (relative to the workspace).
*   `--stop`: Stop the `tmux` session.
*   `--password`: Skip key-based SSH authentication and prompt for a password directly (remote operations only).
*   `--help`: Show help message.

#### Configuration Files

*   Launch files: Set by the `LAUNCH_FILE_PATH` environment variable.
*   Robot config: `$AIRLAB_PATH/robot/robot.conf`
*   Robot info: `$AIRLAB_PATH/robot/robot_info.yaml`

#### Quick Examples

airlab launch local  # Launch locally
airlab launch local --stop  # Stop local session

# Remote operations
airlab launch mt001  # Launch on mt001
airlab launch mt001 --stop  # Stop on mt001
airlab launch mt001 --yaml_file=mt002.yaml  # Launch specific yaml on mt001
```

#### Dependencies

*   `tmuxp`
*   `ssh`
*   `python3` (with PyYAML)
*   `sshpass` (for remote operations)

#### Common Issues

1.  "YAML file not found": Check the `LAUNCH_FILE_PATH` environment variable.
2.  "System not found": Verify the robot name in `robot.conf`.
3.  "Cannot connect": Check network and SSH credentials.
4.  "Failed to get workspace": Verify entries in `robot_info.yaml`.

Note: Use `local` as the robot name for local operations. YAML file paths should be relative to the robot's workspace.

Detailed documentation is available [here](/usr/local/bin/docs/launch.md).

### Docker Commands

This section outlines commands related to managing Docker containers and images. These commands are basically a wrapper around docker. I don't think they are that useful tbh. I tried to use docker context but it is tricky to deal with!

#### docker-build

Builds Docker images locally or remotely. 

##### Usage

```bash
airlab docker-build [OPTIONS]
```

##### Options

*   `--system=<system_name>`: Target system for remote operations.
*   `--compose=<compose_file>`: Docker Compose file (relative to robot workspace. Defaults to `$DOCKER_BUILD_PATH`).
*   `--password`: Skip key-based SSH authentication and prompt for a password directly.
*   `--help`: Display help message.

#### docker-list

Lists Docker containers or images.

##### Usage

```bash
airlab docker-list [OPTIONS]
```

##### Options

*   `--system=<system_name>`: Target system for remote operations.
*   `--images`: List images instead of containers.
*   `--password`: Skip key-based SSH authentication and prompt for a password directly.
*   `--help`: Display help message.

#### docker-join

Joins a running container with an interactive shell.

##### Usage

```bash
airlab docker-join [OPTIONS]
```

##### Options

*   `--system=<system_name>`: Target system for remote operations.
*   `--name=<container_name>`: Container to join.
*   `--password`: Skip key-based SSH authentication and prompt for a password directly.
*   `--help`: Display help message.

#### docker-up

Starts containers using Docker Compose.

##### Usage

```bash
airlab docker-up [OPTIONS]
```

##### Options

*   `--system=<system_name>`: Target system for remote operations.
*   `--compose=<compose_file>`: Docker Compose file (relative to the robot workspace. Defaults to `$DOCKER_UP_PATH`).
*   `--password`: Skip key-based SSH authentication and prompt for a password directly.
*   `--help`: Display help message.

#### Common Features

*   **Remote Operations**: Requires a valid system definition in `robot.conf`, SSH credentials, and correct configuration in `robot_info.yaml`.
*   **Error Handling**: Employs colored error messages and performs validation before executing operations.
*   **Dependencies**: `docker`, `docker-compose`, `ssh`, `sshpass`.
*   **Environment**: Requires `$DOCKER_BUILD_PATH` and `$DOCKER_UP_PATH` to be set.

Detailed documentation is available [here](/usr/local/bin/docs/docker-commands.md).

---

### ros2

Pass-through wrapper that runs an arbitrary `ros2` sub-command inside a transient Docker container, then stops and removes the container when the command exits (via `docker run --rm`).

The current working directory is bind-mounted into the container at the same path with `-w $PWD`, so relative paths and absolute paths under `$PWD` resolve correctly. `--network=host` is set so DDS discovery reaches nodes on the host.

#### Usage

```bash
airlab ros2 [--image=<image>] <ros2-command> [args...]
```

#### Wrapper Options

Wrapper-specific flags must appear before the `ros2` sub-command. Once a non-wrapper token is seen, every remaining argument is passed through to `ros2` inside the container — so `airlab ros2 bag --help` forwards `--help` to `ros2 bag`, not to the wrapper.

*   `--image=<image>`: Use a specific Docker image. Default: auto-detect a local image whose tag contains `ros2`. May also be set via the `AIRLAB_ROS2_IMAGE` environment variable.
*   `--help`: Show the wrapper's help message.

#### Quick Examples

```bash
airlab ros2 bag info ./recording                # inspect a bag in the current dir
airlab ros2 topic list                          # list topics on the host
airlab ros2 --image=dtc/dtc:x86-03-ros2 \
    run my_pkg my_node                          # pin a specific image
AIRLAB_ROS2_IMAGE=dtc/dtc:x86-03-ros2 \
    airlab ros2 doctor                          # same, via env var
```

#### Notes

*   If multiple local images match `ros2`, the wrapper refuses to guess and asks you to pick one with `--image=` or `AIRLAB_ROS2_IMAGE`.
*   A TTY is allocated only when both stdin and stdout are real terminals, so piping (e.g. `airlab ros2 topic list | grep foo`) works.
*   Files created by `ros2` inside the container (e.g. `ros2 bag record` output) will be owned by the container's default user (typically `root`), since no `--user` mapping is applied.

#### Dependencies

*   `docker`
*   A local Docker image whose tag contains `ros2` (or one specified with `--image=` / `AIRLAB_ROS2_IMAGE`).

---

### VCS Commands

This section describes commands for interacting with version control systems. This is based on [vcstool](https://github.com/dirk-thomas/vcstool) which is developed by Thomas Dirk. These tools lets you deal with multiple repositories at the same time.

#### init

Initializes local repositories based on a YAML configuration.

##### Usage

```bash
airlab vcs init [OPTIONS]
```

##### Options

*   `--repo_file=FILE`: YAML file (default: `repos.yaml`).
*   `--path=DIR`: Local directory. If not specified, the directory from the YAML file is used.
*   `--all`: Apply the operation to all YAML files in the version-control directory.
*   `--here`: Re-initialize repos in the current directory using its `AIRLAB_REPO_FILE`.
*   `--here --check`: Compare the current directory structure against the YAML.
*   `--here --from-scratch`: Delete all YAML-defined repo folders and re-clone from scratch.
*   `--entry=NAME`: Only initialize a single repository entry from the YAML file.
*   `--help`: Display help message.

#### pull

Pulls changes from remote repositories to the local workspace.

##### Usage

```bash
airlab vcs pull [OPTIONS]
```

##### Options

*   `--no-rebase`: Disable rebasing.
*   `--help`: Display help message.

#### push

Pushes local changes to remote repositories. With `--tags=<name>`, pushes a single named tag instead of branch refs, deduplicated by remote URL with the same drift gate as [`tag --push`](#tag).

##### Usage

```bash
airlab vcs push [OPTIONS]
```

##### Options

*   `--tags=<name>`: Push the named tag (instead of branch refs). Walks the current directory, finds git repositories (skipping submodules), groups them by normalized remote URL, and runs `git push origin refs/tags/<name>` once per unique URL. Refuses if any group's clones have the tag pointing at different commits, unless `--force` is also given.
*   `--force`: With `--tags=`, overwrite the remote tag and skip the drift gate.
*   `--dry-run`: With `--tags=`, show what would be pushed without actually pushing.
*   `--help`: Display help message.

##### Quick Examples

```bash
airlab vcs push                       # push branch refs (vcstool default)
airlab vcs push --tags=v1.0.0         # push tag v1.0.0, deduped by URL
airlab vcs push --tags=v1.0.0 --dry-run
airlab vcs push --tags=v1.0.0 --force # overwrite remote, skip drift gate
```

#### status

Displays the status of local repositories.

##### Usage

```bash
airlab vcs status [OPTIONS]
```

##### Options

*   `--help`: Display help message.
* `--show-branch`: Show the current branch of the repository

#### update

Updates repositories by pulling latest changes and initializing any new repos. Must be run from a directory containing `AIRLAB_REPO_FILE`.

##### Usage

```bash
airlab vcs update [OPTIONS]
```

##### Options

*   `--help`: Display help message.

##### Steps

1.  Pull all existing repos (stops on first failure).
2.  Run `airlab vcs init --here` to clone any missing repos.
3.  Pull all repos again (collects failures and shows a summary).

#### check

Find repository drift in two complementary modes. Run before `airlab vcs tag` to make sure shared clones agree.

##### Usage

```bash
airlab vcs check [OPTIONS]
```

##### Modes

*   **Default (filesystem mode):** Walks the current directory recursively, finds every git repository (skipping submodules and linked worktrees), groups them by normalized remote URL, and flags any group whose clones are not all on the same commit. Equivalent ssh and https URLs collapse to the same group. Output is split into `[DRIFT]` (red), `[BRANCH SKEW]` (yellow), `[OK]` (green), `[NO ORIGIN]`, and `[DIRTY]` sections.
*   **`--version-control` mode:** Reads every YAML file under `$AIRLAB_PATH/version_control/`. Flags any URL pinned to multiple `version:` values across YAMLs (`[VERSION DRIFT]`) and any duplicate URLs within a single YAML (`[DUPLICATE URL]`).

##### Options

*   `--version-control`: Scan YAMLs in `$AIRLAB_PATH/version_control/` instead of walking PWD.
*   `--no-progress`: Disable the progress bar (also auto-disabled when stderr is not a terminal).
*   `--help`: Display help message.

##### Exit Codes

*   `0`: No drift / no duplicates found.
*   `1`: Drift, duplicate URLs, or YAML parse errors detected — usable in scripts and CI.

##### Quick Examples

```bash
airlab cd && airlab vcs check         # walk the workspace, flag commit drift
airlab vcs check --version-control    # cross-YAML version drift + intra-YAML dupes
airlab vcs check --no-progress        # piped/CI-friendly run
```

#### tag

Recursively create a git tag at HEAD of every repository under the current directory, skipping submodules. Optionally push the tag to origin once per unique remote URL (deduplicated, with a drift gate).

##### Usage

```bash
airlab vcs tag <tag_name> [OPTIONS]
```

##### Arguments

*   `<tag_name>`: Name of the tag to create (e.g. `v1.0.0`).

##### Options

*   `-m, --message=<msg>`: Annotated tag message. Default: `airlab vcs tag <name> on <ISO date>`.
*   `--lightweight`: Create a lightweight tag (no message). Mutually exclusive with `-m` / `--message`.
*   `--force`: Overwrite an existing local tag. With `--push`, also overwrites the remote tag and skips the drift gate.
*   `--push`: After tagging, push the tag to origin once per unique remote URL. Refuses to push if shared clones are not on the same commit, unless `--force` is also set. The repository with the lexicographically smallest path is chosen as the source for each push.
*   `--dry-run`: Print what would be done without making any changes.
*   `--no-progress`: Disable the progress bar (also auto-disabled when stderr is not a terminal).
*   `--help`: Display help message.

##### Behavior

*   Annotated tags by default; the auto-generated message records the tag name and an ISO-8601 UTC timestamp.
*   A dirty working tree triggers a `[WARN]` line but does not block tagging — the tag attaches to whatever HEAD currently points at.
*   With `--push`, a repo cloned in N workspaces is pushed exactly once. The drift gate refuses publication if the same logical repo has different SHAs across workspaces.

##### Recommended Workflow

```bash
airlab cd
airlab vcs check                      # confirm no [DRIFT]
airlab vcs tag v1.0.0 --push          # tag everything and publish, deduped
```

If you want to tag now and push later:

```bash
airlab vcs tag v1.0.0
airlab vcs push --tags=v1.0.0
```

##### Quick Examples

```bash
airlab vcs tag v1.0.0                                # annotated tag, no push
airlab vcs tag v1.0.0 --message="release 1.0"        # custom message
airlab vcs tag v1.0.0 --lightweight                  # lightweight tag
airlab vcs tag v1.0.0 --push                         # tag + dedup-push
airlab vcs tag v1.0.0 --push --force                 # overwrite remote tag
airlab vcs tag v1.0.0 --dry-run                      # preview only
```

#### Progress Bar

Both `vcs check` (filesystem mode) and `vcs tag` show a progress bar on stderr during their two silent phases — the directory walk and the per-repo `git config` / `rev-parse` / `status` collection. Across hundreds of repositories these phases would otherwise look hung.

```
[████████░░░░░░░░░░░░] 145/347  inspecting: ws/src/path/to/repo
```

*   Stderr only, so piped/redirected stdout stays clean.
*   Auto-disabled when stderr is not a TTY.
*   `--no-progress` flag forces it off even on a TTY (useful in CI / scripts).
*   The tag and push **execution** loops are not wrapped — they already emit one `✓` / `✗` line per repository.

#### Common Features

*   **Error Handling**: Employs colored error messages and performs validation before executing operations.
*   **Dependencies**: `git`, `vcstool`, `bash`.
*   **Environment**: Requires `$AIRLAB_PATH` to be set.

Detailed documentation is available [here](/usr/local/bin/docs/version-control-commands.md).

### cd

This command changes the current working directory to a path relative to `$AIRLAB_PATH`. It works like the standard `cd` command but always starts from the airlab workspace root.

> **Note:** `airlab cd` is implemented as a shell function (not a standalone script) because a subprocess cannot change the parent shell's working directory. In Bash, the function is loaded from the completion script at `/etc/bash_completion.d/airlab`. In Zsh, it is loaded from `/etc/airlab/airlab.zsh` (sourced via `~/.zshrc`).

#### Usage

```bash
airlab cd [path]
```

#### Arguments

*   `path`: A directory path relative to `$AIRLAB_PATH`. If omitted, changes to `$AIRLAB_PATH` itself.

#### Quick Examples

```bash
airlab cd                   # cd to $AIRLAB_PATH
airlab cd docker            # cd to $AIRLAB_PATH/docker
airlab cd robot             # cd to $AIRLAB_PATH/robot
airlab cd version_control   # cd to $AIRLAB_PATH/version_control
```

#### Tab Completion

`airlab cd <TAB>` lists directories under `$AIRLAB_PATH`, and supports nested path completion (e.g., `airlab cd docker/<TAB>`).

## Workspace Structure

### Overview

This workspace design is intended to simplify integration and operation of robotic systems utilizing ROS 2 and Docker. The workspace is structured into folders dedicated to specific tasks, ensuring efficient management of configurations, dependencies, and runtime environments and enabling a smooth and scalable development process.

### Directory Structure

The workspace follows this hierarchical structure:

```
workspace/
│
├── docker/
│   ├── sample.dockerfile            # Dockerfile to build the container
│   ├── docker-compose.yml           # Compose file to manage multiple containers
│
├── launch/
│   ├── sample.yaml                 # Launch file for starting nodes or systems
│
├── robot/
│   ├── robot.conf                  # Configuration file for robot-specific settings
│   ├── robot_info.yaml             # System-generated YAML file containing robot information
│
├── version_control/
│   ├── repos.yaml                  # Sample repositories for version control using git
│
└── airlab.env                      # Environment file for airlab command settings
```

### Folder Breakdown

#### docker/

This folder contains all Docker-related files, including the **Dockerfile** and **docker-compose.yml**, which are essential for setting up the containerized environment.

-   **sample.dockerfile**: The primary Dockerfile used to build the robot's container.
-   **docker-compose.yml**: A Docker Compose file for managing multi-container setups, which simplifies running and scaling multiple services or systems simultaneously.

##### Usage:

-   Add additional Dockerfiles and compose files to this directory as needed. Ensure that any changes align with the standard structure and naming conventions.

#### launch/

This folder holds all **launch** files in the [tmuxp format](https://github.com/tmux-python/tmuxp), a powerful tool for managing tmux sessions programmatically. Launch files specify the startup procedures for nodes or systems and are crucial for orchestrating the robot's operational flow.

-   **sample.yaml**: A sample launch file configured to use tmuxp format for managing multi-session tmux setups.

##### Usage:

-   Add new launch files as needed, ensuring that they follow the tmuxp format to maintain consistency and compatibility.

#### robot/

This folder contains the configuration files that define robot-specific settings and metadata. It is essential for ensuring that the robot's environment is properly configured and that the system can integrate various robots into the workspace.

-   **robot.conf**: A configuration file to define the IP addresses of remote systems. The format is simple:

    ```
    mt001=dtc@10.223.1.99
    mt002=dtc@10.3.1.102
    ```

    Each line maps a robot identifier (e.g., `mt001`) to an IP address and a username.

-   **robot_info.yaml**: A dynamically generated YAML file that contains detailed information about the robots in the system, including metadata such as IP addresses, usernames, and robot models.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    spot1:
      ws_path: "/home/airlab/airlab_ws"
      robot_ssh: "airlab@10.3.1.14"
      last_updated: "2024-12-22 19:48:31"
    ```

##### Usage:

-   The **robot_info.yaml** file is automatically updated by the `airlab` command to reflect the latest robot configurations.
-   The **robot.conf** file must be manually updated to include the IP addresses of new robots as they are added to the system.

#### version_control/

This folder is responsible for managing the version control configurations for the repositories used in the project. It utilizes [python-vcstool](https://github.com/dirk-thomas/vcstool) to streamline version management and facilitate easy integration of external repositories.

-   **repos.yaml**: This file lists all the repositories required for the project. The file follows the vcs format supported by vcstool. Each repository is defined by its type, URL, and the version/branch to be used.

    Example format:

    ```yaml
    dir: src
    repositories:
      vcstool:
        type: git
        url: git@github.com:dirk-thomas/vcstool.git
        version: master
    ```

    In this example, `type` specifies the version control system (e.g., `git`), `url` provides the repository location, and `version` refers to the branch (e.g., `master`).
    The path provided to the dir is relative to the workspace_path.

##### Usage:

-   Regularly update the **repos.yaml** file to add new repositories, update existing ones, or change versions to ensure your workspace stays synchronized with the latest code and dependencies.
- You can also add other yaml files to **version_control/** for specific purposes.

#### airlab.env

The **airlab.env** file configures the environment variables and runtime settings specific to the `airlab` command. It is essential for ensuring that the necessary paths, configurations, and system parameters are set up correctly.

##### Key points:

-   This file defines system paths, environment variables, and settings unique to the robot's workspace.
-   **airlab.env** is **system-specific** and **not synchronized** when you run the sync or setup commands. This means each system or robot may have a different configuration.

##### Usage:

-   Make sure to configure this file correctly for each system to ensure that the `airlab` command functions as expected.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: You are welcome to rename or create new files as needed, but **please do not modify the folder structure**. Renaming or deleting folders like `docker/` or altering their names may cause the tool to malfunction and prevent it from working properly.

## Future Work

This was a weekend project through which I learned scripting. I would love new ideas that we can add here. It should probably be adding ROS2 functionality to the tool!
